  - Log each JobCard implementation with screen name and validation status
  - Use MCP byterover to store successful JobCard pattern for consistency
  - _Requirements: 5.1-5.6_

- [x] 2.1 Navigation bar styling with MCP validation
  - Use grepSearch to locate BottomNavigationBar in user_home_screen.dart and employee_home_screen.dart

  - Use MCP context7 to get Card widget and layout documentation for replacement
  - Remove all fl_chart imports and widget references completely
  - Replace with Card-based statistics using subtitle1 for names, headline1 for numbers
  - Use getDiagnostics to ensure no compilation errors after chart removal
  - Test analytics screen functionality and log data display correctness
  - Verify no business logic was altered by checking data sources remain intact
  - Use MCP byterover to store analytics card pattern for future reference
  - _Requirements: 7.1-7.5, 9.1-9.5_

- [x] 2.3 Icon replacement with MCP documentation lookup
  - Use grepSearch results from pre-flight to target high-impact Icons.* usage
  - Use MCP context7 to get EvaIcons documentation and available icon mappings
  - Replace critical icons: Icons.home → EvaIcons.home, Icons.search → EvaIcons.search, etc.
