# Backend Changes Required

This document lists all backend/infrastructure changes that cannot be done through code modifications alone and require Firebase Console access or external configuration.

---

## 1. Firestore Composite Indexes

### Status
ðŸ”´ **REQUIRED** - App shows errors without these indexes

### What's Needed
Create 2 composite indexes in Firestore to enable job statistics queries.

### Why Required
- Firestore requires indexes for queries with multiple `where` clauses on collection groups
- Without indexes: `FAILED_PRECONDITION` errors
- With indexes: Efficient count aggregation queries work properly

### Indexes to Create

#### Index 1: Employment Type Filter
```
Collection Group: jobPostings
Query Scope: Collection group
Fields:
  - isActive (Ascending)
  - employmentType (Ascending)
```

#### Index 2: Work Location Filter
```
Collection Group: jobPostings
Query Scope: Collection group
Fields:
  - isActive (Ascending)
  - workFrom (Ascending)
```

### How to Create

**Method 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
1. Run the app and navigate to home screen
2. Check console/logcat for error messages
3. Copy the Firebase Console URLs from error messages
4. Open URLs in browser - Firebase auto-fills the configuration
5. Click "Create Index" button
6. Wait 5-10 minutes for indexes to build

**Method 2: Manual**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `get-work-48682`
3. Navigate to: Firestore Database â†’ Indexes tab
4. Click "Create Index"
5. Configure as specified above
6. Click "Create"

**Method 3: Firebase CLI**
```bash
# Create firestore.indexes.json in project root
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### Access Required
- Firebase Console access with "Editor" or "Owner" role
- Project: `get-work-48682`

### Impact
- **Without indexes**: Statistics show counts from loaded jobs only (fallback mode)
- **With indexes**: Statistics show accurate total counts from entire database

### Time Required
- Creation: 2 minutes
- Building: 5-10 minutes
- One-time setup

### Risk Level
ðŸŸ¢ **LOW** - Indexes don't modify data, only improve query performance

### Verification
```bash
# After creation, check Firebase Console
# Status should show "Enabled" (not "Building")
```

---

## 2. Firebase Authentication Configuration

### Status
ðŸŸ¢ **CONFIGURED** - Already set up, no action needed

### Current Setup
- Email/Password authentication enabled
- Password reset emails configured
- Firebase Auth working correctly

### Future Considerations
- If adding new auth providers (Google, Facebook, etc.), requires Firebase Console configuration
- Email templates can be customized in Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Templates

---

## 3. Firebase Storage Rules (If Applicable)

### Status
ðŸŸ¡ **REVIEW RECOMMENDED**

### What to Check
If the app uploads profile pictures or resumes to Firebase Storage:

```javascript
// Recommended Storage Rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /companies/{companyId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Access Required
- Firebase Console â†’ Storage â†’ Rules tab

### Risk Level
ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM** - Incorrect rules can expose user data

---

## 4. Firestore Security Rules

### Status
ðŸŸ¡ **REVIEW RECOMMENDED**

### Current Concern
Ensure proper security rules are in place for:
- User data access
- Job postings access
- Application submissions
- Company data

### Recommended Rules Structure
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users_specific/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Employees can read/write their own data
    match /employees/{employeeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == employeeId;
    }
    
    // Job postings - read by all authenticated, write by company owner
    match /jobs/{companyId}/jobPostings/{jobId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Add company ownership check
    }
    
    // Applications - read/write by applicant and company
    match /jobs/{companyId}/jobPostings/{jobId}/applicants/{applicantId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     (request.auth.uid == applicantId || 
                      request.auth.uid == companyId);
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == applicantId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Access Required
- Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database â†’ Rules tab

### Risk Level
ðŸ”´ **HIGH** - Incorrect rules can expose sensitive data

---

## 5. Environment Variables / API Keys

### Status
ðŸŸ¢ **CONFIGURED** - Firebase config in code

### Current Setup
- Firebase configuration in `lib/firebase_options.dart`
- API keys properly configured

### Security Note
- Ensure `firebase_options.dart` is not committed to public repositories
- API keys should be restricted in Firebase Console â†’ Project Settings â†’ API Keys

### Access Required
- Firebase Console â†’ Project Settings

---

## 6. Cloud Functions (If Needed in Future)

### Status
âšª **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Optional for future

### Potential Use Cases
1. **Job Statistics Aggregation**
   - Maintain real-time counts in a separate document
   - Update counts when jobs are created/deleted
   - Eliminates need for count queries

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Send job application confirmations
   - Notify employers of new applications
   - Send job recommendations

3. **Data Cleanup**
   - Archive old job postings
   - Clean up expired applications
   - Maintain data consistency

### If Implementing
```bash
# Initialize Cloud Functions
firebase init functions

# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Access Required
- Firebase Console with Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan
- Cloud Functions enabled

---

## 7. Firebase Hosting (If Deploying Web Version)

### Status
âšª **NOT APPLICABLE** - Mobile app only

### If Needed
```bash
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---
