```bash
firebase firestore:indexes --project look-gig-test
```

Or visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/look-gig-test/firestore/indexes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Resume Upload Still Fails
**Check:**
- Is `file_picker` imported correctly?
- Are you running the latest build?
- Check console for error logs

**Solution:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Issue: Registration Still Fails
**Check:**
- Are you seeing 🔵 or 🔴 logs in console?
- Is the error "network_error" or "permission-denied"?

**Solution:**
- Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
- Verify Google Sign-In is enabled
- Verify SHA certificates are added (run: `firebase apps:android:sha:list ...`)

### Issue: Permission Denied on Chat
**Check:**
- Is the Firestore index still building?
- Run: `firebase firestore:indexes --project look-gig-test`

**Solution:**
- Wait for index to finish building (2-5 minutes)
- No action needed - will work automatically

### Issue: App Crashes
**Check:**
- Check logcat for detailed error
- Look for "MyFirebaseMessagingService" or "MultiDex" errors

**Solution:**
- Verify `MyApplication.kt` and `MyFirebaseMessagingService.kt` exist
- Verify AndroidManifest.xml uses `.MyApplication`
- Rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter run`
